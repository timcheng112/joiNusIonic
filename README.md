# Description
- Project has 2 front-facing applications, a web application and a mobile application. These applications work together and share a common back-end and database.
- Mobile application is accessible by users from the NUS community. This is the platform for users to organize and join socially-hosted events in NUS. Users can post events and book venues concurrently through joiNUS, making it a hassle-free process.
- Web application for administrators of the joiNUS platform. These administrators will constitute personnel from the NUS Students’ Union and the various Halls/Residential Colleges (RC)/Clubs of NUS. Each student body will be given an administrator account, and be given access to manage the locations within their control. Hall/RC/Club administrators will be able to manage the facilities allocated to them, and may block out certain booking time slots for internal events.
- Web application is located in https://github.com/timcheng112/joiNus


# What is joiNUS?
- joiNUS is a free-to-use social application used by NUS staff and students to organise and participate in group events within NUS. It helps users to find new people with similar interests to participate in their events. For example, a user may organize a pickup basketball game and find three other players through the app. Organizers can specify joining criteria for participants in the activity description, for example, the organizer can say that only amateur players should participate in a volleyball game, or that only female players are invited to join a netball game.
- The app’s functionality is not restricted to only sports. Other social events such as board games, blind dates and art jams are also possible applications. When creating the event, the host will specify the location or facility, and also allows non-in-person events such as online gaming.
- joiNUS also doubles as a booking app for facilities, where users use tokens to book facilities or join events. Booking of a facility will require some number of tokens, while joining an event would cost fewer tokens. Events that are held in open spaces or those that do not require a physical location would not require tokens.
- A social credit system serves as a form of gamification, where credits are gained upon participation of activities, while credits can be forfeited if a user does not turn up for an event. This system encourages active participation while deterring no-shows especially for events that require booking of facilities.
